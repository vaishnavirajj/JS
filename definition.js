//JS me essa function jo kuch ni return krta h wo undefined return krta h

//Undefined is a value-->In this case we declared variable but don;t give any value to it.

//not defined is an error-->In this case we don't declared any variable but try to access then it throws an error and that error is called not defined.

//Null is also a value--> In this case we try to find something but it doesn't exist then it gives null.
//Null is recieved when something is not found
